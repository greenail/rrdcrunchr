Tool data into google chart api from collectd driven rrd db on linux

config file rcr.yaml

plan: add merb slice to drive resolution and time intervals, and tinyhttp install

need to figure out what to do with min/max/avg etc


wondering if gchart is slowing things down, adding gridlines and line widths would be nice
