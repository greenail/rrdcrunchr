Tool data into google chart api from collectd driven rrd db on linux

config file rcr.yaml

plan: add merb slice to drive resolution and time intervals, and tinyhttp install

need to figure out what to do with min/max/avg etc


adding min/max x axis labels would be good
add candle chart for min/max/avg
